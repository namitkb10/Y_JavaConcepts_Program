		//Singleton design pattern in Java
		
		// Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".
		// In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
		// There are two forms of singleton design pattern
		// Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
		// Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
		
		// Advantage of Singleton design pattern
		// Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.
